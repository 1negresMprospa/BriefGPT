Poedit Pro has many benefits that make it a great choice for translators and developers who work with gettext and XLIFF files. Here are some of the advantages of using Poedit Pro:

- \*\*Online suggestions\*\*: Poedit Pro provides real-time suggestions for your translations from your own translation history and from the shared online user-contributed translation databases[^1^]. This helps you avoid mistakes and inconsistencies, and learn from other translators.
- \*\*Machine translation\*\*: Poedit Pro includes machine translation engines that can help you translate faster and better. You can choose from Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, or DeepL[^2^], depending on your preference and language pair. You can also use machine translation to pre-translate entire files at once, and then make corrections as needed.
- \*\*Statistics\*\*: Poedit Pro automatically counts the number of characters, words and lines for each file, showing your translation progress in the status bar[^1^]. You can also access detailed statistics about your translations that professional translators use to bill their clients.
- \*\*WordPress support\*\*: Poedit Pro makes it easy to translate WordPress themes and plugins without any prior experience[^1^]. Poedit Pro can analyse the structure of themes and plugins, create a PO file in the right place, and fill it with original strings. You can also update your translations with new strings whenever the source code changes. Poedit Pro can also work remotely with WordPress installations via FTP, so you don't have to download or upload any files.
- \*\*Twig and Volt support\*\*: Poedit Pro supports extraction of translation strings from Twig and Volt templates out of the box[^1^]. Twig and Volt are popular templating languages for web development, used by WordPress, Craft CMS, Symfony, Drupal, Grav, Phalcon, and more.
- \*\*Support\*\*: Poedit Pro comes with direct, personal and fast email support from the app developer himself[^1^]. You can ask questions, report bugs, request features, or get help with any issues you may encounter.

With Poedit Pro, you can translate faster, easier, and better than ever before. Whether you are a professional translator or a hobbyist developer, Poedit Pro will help you achieve your goals.
