### Step 1: Create a new project
 
To start a new project, click on \*\*File > New\*\* in the software menu. You will see a window like this:
 ![New project window](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/sites/default/files/2019-03/robot-structural-analysis-professional-2019-new-project-dialog-box.png) 
Here you can choose the name, location, and type of your project. You can also select the units, codes, and standards that you want to use. Click on \*\*OK\*\* to create your project.
 
### Step 2: Define the geometry of your structure
 
To define the geometry of your structure, you can use various tools such as nodes, bars, panels, openings, supports, loads, etc. You can access these tools from the \*\*Geometry\*\* tab in the software menu. You can also import the geometry from other Autodesk products such as Revit or AutoCAD. To import the geometry from Revit, click on \*\*File > Import > Revit Structure\*\* and select the Revit file that you want to import. You will see a window like this:
 ![Import Revit Structure window](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/sites/default/files/2019-03/robot-structural-analysis-professional-2019-import-revit-structure-dialog-box.png) 
Here you can choose the options for importing the Revit model such as materials, sections, loads, etc. Click on \*\*OK\*\* to import the model. You will see your structure in the graphical window of Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis Professional 2015.
 
### Step 3: Assign the properties and loads to your structure
 
To assign the properties and loads to your structure, you can use various tools such as materials, sections, supports, loads cases, load combinations, etc. You can access these tools from the \*\*Data\*\* tab in the software menu. You can also use the \*\*Properties\*\* panel on the right side of the graphical window to modify the properties and loads of selected elements. For example, to assign a material to a bar element, select the bar element and click on the \*\*Material\*\* button in the \*\*Properties\*\* panel. You will see a window like this:
